# Robot Cleaner :robot_face:

## Overview
The **Robot Cleaner** project simulates the movement and cleaning process of a robotic cleaner on a two-dimensional plane. This project showcases the robot's ability to navigate a virtual environment and keep it clean by integrating modular design and scalable technologies.

---

## Requirements
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x
- **Docker**: Installed for containerized execution (optional)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Run Locally
Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Start the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. The project will be accessible at:
   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
